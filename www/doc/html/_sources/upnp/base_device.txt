:mod:`base_device` --- Basic device classes
============================================

.. module: base_device
    :synopsis: Basic device related classes

The base_device module contains two classes that have all the attributes and methods that are common to all devices.

BaseDevice class
-----------------
BaseDevice is the base class for devices. On :ref:`python-brisa <python-brisa>`,
devices are represented by objects. For the control point API, a device has a
set of methods for dealing with events, variables and so on. For the device API
(deploying devices), a device contains methods directed to the deployment.

The BaseDevice class contains attributes that are common for both device-side and
control-point-side devices. Even so, it's very unlikely for users to use
BaseDevice directly.

Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^
The BaseDevice class attributes describes the device in some aspects, such as:

* The type of the device
* Its location, uuid and friendly name
* If it has a parent device (embedded device), its manufacturer information
* Informations about the model of the device and its serial number

Methods
^^^^^^^^
The BaseDevice class methods make it possible to deal with the device and its
services. They are:

.. function:: rem_service_by_id(id)

   It removes the service that matches the given id.

.. function:: add_device(device)

    Adds the given device into this device.

.. function:: rem_device(device)

    Removes the given device from this device.

.. function:: add_service(service)

    Adds the given service into this device.

.. function:: get_service_by_type(service_type)

    Returns a service given its type.

.. function:: rem_service(service)

    Removes a service, if present on the device.

.. function:: is_root_device()

    Returns True if this device is a root device (it contains embedded devices).


BaseDeviceIcon class
---------------------
Also a base class for devices, it contains attributes that describes the
Device's icon, such as width, height, depth, url and mimetype.

Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^
The BaseDeviceIcon attributes are:

* Mimetype - mimetype for the icon
* Width - icon width
* Height - icon height
* Depth - icon depth
* Url - the icon's url

Methods
^^^^^^^^
BaseDeviceIcon's methods are:

.. function:: get_mimetype()

    Returns the icon's mimetype in string form.

.. function:: get_width()

    Returns the icon's width in string form.

.. function:: get_depth()

    Returns the icon's depth in string form.

.. function:: get_url()

    Return the icon's url in string form.
