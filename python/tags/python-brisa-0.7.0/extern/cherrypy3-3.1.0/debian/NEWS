python-cherrypy (2.1.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  This release is incompatible with CherryPy 2.0. If you are using
  that version, take a look at this page for how to upgrade your code:

    http://www.cherrypy.org/wiki/WhatsNewIn21

  This release also marks a big overhaul on the package layout, which
  is now using python-support, and also providing EGG-INFO information
  so that systems like TurboGears are able to find and use CherryPy.
