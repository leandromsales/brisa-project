Notes

This section contains notes and some information about the tags.

* python-brisa from 0.0 to 0.2 weren't tagged.
* python-brisa from 0.3 to 0.7.1 did include our media server and media renderer
applications.
* brisa-configuration-tool applies ONLY to python-brisa 0.7.*
* python-brisa from 0.8 on is only about the UPnP framework. From this point on
applications will be deployed separatelly from the framework, starting at
version 0.1.0. This means that brisa-media-*-0.1.0 packages will work with
python-brisa >= 0.8.
