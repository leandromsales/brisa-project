cherrypy3 (3.0.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Piotr Ożarowski ]
  * Vcs-Browser and Homepage fields added
  * Rename XS-Vcs-Svn to Vcs-Svn

  [ Sandro Tosi ]
  * debian/control
    - fix Vcs-Browser field

  [ Gustavo Noronha Silva ]
  * This update addresses the following security issue:
    - Directory traversal vulnerability in the _get_file_path function
      in filter/sessionfilter.py allows remote attackers to create or
      delete arbitrary files, and possibly read and write portions of
      arbitrary files, via a crafted session id in a cookie
      (CVE-2008-0252).
  * debian/control:
  - updated standards-version to 3.7.3; no changes

cherrypy3 (3.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * debian/watch:
  - updated to understand the new layout of the new download
    source for CherryPy
  * debian/rules:
  - I heartly agree with Sam Clegg on this; the tutorial should be
    in /usr/share/doc/python-cherrypy3, not inside the Python package
    namespace (Closes: #415526)
  * debian/control:
  - updated python-support and python-all-dev version requirements
    and moved them to build-deps because they are needed on clean
  * debian/control, debian/rules, debian/python-cherrypy3.doc-base.api,
    debian/python-cherrypy3.install:
  - build API documentation as a step in the package build and install
    it; this uses epydoc

python-cherrypy (2.2.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules, debian/control:
  - updated to follow the new Python Policy, build-depending on the
    newest versions of cdbs, python-support and debhelper
    (Closes: #373517)
  * debian/python-cherrypy.{postinst,prerm}:
  - removed; generated by python-support

 -- Gustavo Noronha Silva <kov@debian.org>  Sun,  4 Jun 2006 23:50:37 -0300

python-cherrypy (2.2.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/02_eggify.diff:
  - fixed to only patch setup.py, so that it imports setup
    from setuptools instead of distutils; ez_setup is not
    needed

  - stop warning about the profiler module not being packaged
    in the main python distribution; that is documented in
    README.Debian

  - new uscan support file, using the sf.net trick

python-cherrypy (2.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/*:
  - renamed to have numbers defining the order in which they
    should be applied
  * debian/README.Debian:
  - added, documenting the Python profiler only being available
    in a non-free package problem
  * debian/rules, debian/python-cherrypy.{postinst,prerm}:
  - install py files to the python-cherrypy instead of cherrypy
    for python-support; using the package name is the correct,
    documented way of doing it.
  * debian/patches/01_auto-reload-with-python-support.diff:
  - removed because python-support >= 0.2, which I depend upon
    provides symlinks for the .py files;
  * debian/control:
  - depend on python-support >= 0.2; see above
  - Standards-Version to 3.7.2, no changes

 -- Gustavo Noronha Silva <kov@debian.org>  Thu,  4 May 2006 00:00:28 -0300

python-cherrypy (2.1.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Debian revision with source package name change
  * changed source package name back to something more generic, since
    it seems like there won't be compatibility breakage again anytime
    soon
  * use python-support
  * debian/patches/eggify.diff:
  - add patch to provide EGG-INFO stuff, so that packages that depend
    on that information, such as TurboGears, will be able to use
    CherryPy
  * debian/patches/auto-reload-with-python-support.diff:
  - auto-reload doesn't like the .py files to be in a different path as the
    pyc files; I need a better solution for this, but for now the auto-reloader
    simply ignores the files in the cherrypy distribution (which is OK, since they
    are not supposed to be modified after the package is installed).
  * debian/control:
  - build-depends on python-setup-tools >= 0.6a9-1, needed to provide the
    EGG-INFO stuff
  * debian/copyright:
  - de-wikify the authors names
  * debian/control, debian/rules:
  - add dummy transition packages for python-cherrypy2.1, and deal with what
    cdbs's python stuff likes to do when it sees lots of python${ver}-module
    packages on the control file =D
  * debian/NEWS.Debian:
  - document big changes, and that this version is incompatible with
    CherryPy 2.0

  * New backwards-incompatible version, thus new source

  - enhanced description, mention the backwards incompatibility
    and that it's part of the Turbo Gears framework
  - changed maintainer to myself
  * debian/copyright:
  - modified downloaded from location to mention cherrypy.org instead
    of the sourceforge page
  * debian/rules:
  - avoid compressing the pdf and py files on the tutorial documentation

    directory since there's no tutorial in there
