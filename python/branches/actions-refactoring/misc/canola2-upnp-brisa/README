Status:
- Based latest brisa svn which will be release 0.9.0 (some fixes on the control point and webserver)
- Browse working fine (just like the old upnp plugin from canola)
- Logging not working (dunno why. I debugged with prints)


TODO:
- A screen between browse and play so that the renderer can be chosen. Requires
  some code learning from the other plugins located at
  http://openbossa.indt.org/canola/developer.html, specially the youtube one. I
  think there we will find exactly how to do it. AFAIK, we need to create an
  edje view just writing an edc file (http://docs.enlightenment.org/api/edje/html/edcref.html)
  and compile it with edje_cc. We also need to write a controller for this
  interface, which takes edje decorators on the methods for interface callbacks.

  In a few lines:
  Write the edc defining programs inside it use these program's signals to
  connect the callbacks on the controller. Attach the controller to the view.

- Debian packaging
- Cleanup
- Profiling compared to the old upnp plugin (important)


Developing:
1. Get http://openbossa.indt.org/canola/source_files/canola2-beta9.tar.bz2 and
   extract it
2. sudo apt-get install mplayer (make sure it's installed)
3. Copy canola2-upnp-brisa to canola/plugins
4. Compile the default theme (we will do all themes only at the end)

	cd canola/
	Just run “./run-canola –shell” to set-up the environment and you’ll have the edje_cc compiler available
    cd plugins/canola2-upnp-brisa/data/themes/default
    ../../../../../usr/bin/edje_cc default.edc
    mv default.edj ../../../../../THEMES/default-upnp.edj
    cp images/upnp_search.png ../../../../../data/themes/default/upnp_search.png

5. Work on canola/plugins/canola2-upnp-brisa/upnp/model.py and test it with
   run_canola.sh
