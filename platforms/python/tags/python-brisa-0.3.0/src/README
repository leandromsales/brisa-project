Brisa UPnP A/V Framework
========================

Introduction
------------

Brisa is a UPnP implementation written in python. Brisa provides
the ability to create UPnP devices like MediaServers and 
MediaRenderers (not implemented yet). It will offer a plugin
architecture enabling the addition of new services such as Flickr,
Rhapsody, etc, and use them as UPnP services. Brisa is compatible with
the UPnP A/V specifications:
	MediaServer 1.0
	ConnectionManager 1.0
	ContentDirectory 1.0
	MediaRenderer 1.0

The main target of this project is the Maemo Platform, but it should work on any O.S. with
python interpreter installed.
